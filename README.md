# tiochatopiano
a SuperDirt sample pack


made from a recording of Tio Chato's old piano
in Abuelitos den
aqui hay una foto (tiochatopiano.jpg)




place these .wav files in a folder (maybe called tiochatopiano)
place the tiochatopiano folder in a folder that gets called on SuperDirt startup

now you have acces to this sound in Tidal
(remember to use $ note instead of $ n)
